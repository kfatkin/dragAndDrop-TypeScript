# Project Tracker - Drag-N-Drop Project Management

## About

This is a basic custom framework used to demonstrate how TypeScript is used in common Frameworks such as Angular.
It demonstrates all of the best TypeScript functionality, such as Decorators, Generics, and various patterns,
such as the Singleton Pattern. It is meant to run locally using webpack and demonstrate the power of an
Object Oriented approach in a standard JavaScript, HTML, CSS application.

## Requirements

You need Node.js and NPM installed

## Quick start

    $ npm install
    $ npm run start

## Configuration

The ts.config.json file contains all necessary TypeScript configuration. Once the webpack is running,
run:

```bash
tsc -w
```

This will autocompile the TypeScript code into the dist/ folder. Webpack will
auto-reload once the compiled JavaScript files appear and properly display the project.
